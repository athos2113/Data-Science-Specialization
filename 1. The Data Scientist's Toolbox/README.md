In this course you will get an introduction to the main tools and ideas in the data scientist's toolbox.
The course gives an overview of the data, questions, and tools that data analysts and data scientists work with.
There are two components to this course. The first is a conceptual introduction to the ideas behind turning data
into actionable knowledge. The second is a practical introduction to the tools that will be used in the program
like version control, markdown, git, GitHub, R, and RStudio.

# What you will Learn

1. Create a Github repository

2. Explain essential study design concepts

3. Set up R, R-Studio, Github and other useful tools

4. Understand the data, problems, and tools that data analysts work with


# Peer-graded Assignment: Course Project
>The Course Project for this course is pretty straightforward. Now that you’ve learned about the basic tools
 found in the data scientist’s toolbox, we want to make sure that you’ve assembled those tools and are ready to
 begin using them. This easy project is your chance to demonstrate that you’ve done the basic software setup (R, RStudio, and Github)
 that will get you through the rest of the Data Science Specialization.

>RStudio and Github Project.The course project entails downloading the RStudio, implementing basic commands on GitBash and working on Github
