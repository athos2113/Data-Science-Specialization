Linear models, as their name implies, relates an outcome to a set
 of predictors of interest using linear assumptions.  Regression models,
 a subset of linear models, are the most important statistical analysis
 tool in a data scientist’s toolkit. This course covers regression analysis,
 least squares and inference using regression models. Special cases of the regression model,
 ANOVA and ANCOVA will be covered as well. Analysis of residuals and variability will
 be investigated. The course will cover modern thinking on model selection and novel
 uses of regression models including scatterplot smoothing.

## Peer-graded Assignment: Course Project
You work for Motor Trend, a magazine about the automobile industry.
 Looking at a data set of a collection of cars, they are interested
 in exploring the relationship between a set of variables and miles
 per gallon (MPG) (outcome). They are particularly interested in the following two questions:

1. “Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG”
2. "Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions"
